#Identifying the Problem

Nowadays, the demand for indoor greenhouse gardening is increasing. To grow healthy plants, it is important to nurture them in a suitable living environment. High humidity or excessively high or low temperatures can cause stress to plants. When plants are stressed, their resistance is weakened, which creates favorable conditions for pest infestation. A well-controlled environment with optimal temperature and humidity will increase crop productivity and accelerate water evaporation for nutrient absorption, leading to better quality products and enhanced growth cycle control.

#Research and Data Collection

From 1950 to 2010, humans have caused more than half of the observed temperature increase. The soil temperature has increased much faster in the past 100 years. The average increase is 35.06°F. It may not seem like much, but it is a significant difference for our planet in such a short time. Scientists predict that the earth's temperature will increase more than 30% faster in the future, and by 2100, the overall figure will reach 39.2°F. The first and second industrial revolutions have greatly changed the world by accelerating air pollution. In the 1750s, there were 280 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. By 2005, the ppm of carbon dioxide had risen to 380 ppm. It was a rapid increase in such a short period. In January 2021, this figure had increased to 419.80 ppm. In 2020, there was a significant decrease in emissions due to COVID-19's impact on global industrial sectors. In India, emissions decreased by 41%, but this quickly changed as lockdown restrictions began to loosen.

From the above data, we see that crops need a suitable living environment to grow and thrive. Measuring environmental parameters related to temperature and humidity and adjusting suitable temperature and humidity for crops is extremely necessary. Therefore, our group decided to choose the topic "Designing a Circuit to Measure Temperature and Humidity for Greenhouse Plants."

Design Options

4.1 Measuring and Processing Temperature

We will use a temperature sensor to measure the temperature of the environment. There are many temperature sensors on the market, but we will use a digital sensor that is low cost and easy to integrate into the circuit. The sensor will measure the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit and convert it into digital signals. These signals will be sent to a microcontroller to process the data and convert it into a temperature value that is easily understood by humans. The microcontroller will be programmed to read the sensor data at regular intervals and store it in the memory. Finally, the measured temperature value will be displayed on an LCD screen.

4.2 Measuring and Processing Humidity

We will use a humidity sensor to measure the humidity of the environment. There are many humidity sensors on the market, but we will use a digital sensor that is low cost and easy to integrate into the circuit. The sensor will measure the relative humidity of the air and convert it into digital signals. These signals will be sent to a microcontroller to process the data and convert it into a relative humidity value that is easily understood by humans. The microcontroller will be programmed to read the sensor data at regular intervals and store it in the memory. Finally, the measured humidity value will be displayed on an LCD screen.
